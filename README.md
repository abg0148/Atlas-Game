# Atlas-Game
mimics a game that i used to play in school . Similar to antakshari ,here instead of singing a song starting from the last alphabet name of country or city is used . The one who fails to continue the sequence loses. This script produces a list of all countries and capitals in the same sequence once the user enters a starting country/capital.
